## Shell Project
Create a shell similar to sh in terms of functionality and looks. This is a collaborative project between two students to test their knowledge, technical skill, communication skills, and resourcefulness. Shell Project is the final project of the first trimester at Holberton School.

## Motivation
This project was have us really understand what we have used every day to complete our tasks. We tend to forget how important something is when we use and/or see it so often. Coding a shell made us really appreciate all the little things the shell does for us day in day out.
